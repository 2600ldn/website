London 2600 meetings are similar to those held by [2600 groups around the world](http://www.2600.org/meetings/), and the other 2600 groups in the United Kingdom.

Everybody who is interested in computer and telecoms security and the impact of technology on society is welcome, from both sides of the fence, no matter what your age or level of skill and experience - nobody knows it all, no matter what they claim. You could learn more at these free meetings than from months of study or investigation on your own, but this depends on what you are willing to share and contribute in return. We are mostly British and therefore somewhat shy in public, but it is easy to strike up a conversation with most of us.

- First Friday of every month
- Start at 6:30 at the Trocadero front entrance, on Coventry Street, just off Piccadilly Circus
- Move on elsewhere at 7:30

Over the years London 2600 has played host to:
