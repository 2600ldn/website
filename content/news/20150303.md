New year, new website!

It's early days and we're only just finding our feet, but there are big plans for the site. Also small plans, medium-sized plans, plots, schemes, skullduggery, nefarious goings-on and *shenanigans*. Watch this space for future developments.

Meanwhile, if you have any news or content or suggestions or feedback or if you want to get involved with the running of the site, please let us know via the [mailing list](https://lists.kentgeek.org/mailman/listinfo/london2600) or talk to someone at a meet - they'll be able to point you in the right direction.

Finally, don't forget the meeting this Friday. See you there, hackers . . .
