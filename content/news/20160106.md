Hacky New Year, London!

Since New Year's fell on our meet day this year, all the trains were buggered, and we were all too hung over to travel, the January meet is going to be Friday 8th instead. Apart from that we're using the usual timings and meeting places, so make your way to the Troc between 1830 and 1930 and if you're going to be late keep an eye on IRC or the mailing list for the location of the second venue.

In the mean time we're still looking for website content and ideas, so if you've got something you want to the share with the world then let us know through the usual channels.
