It's that time again - get set for drinking and hackery.

Second venue this month looks like we're going for the [Namco Funscape](http://www.namcofunscape-londonevents.co.uk/). It has a bar and air hockey. I'm sure there are other things to know about it, but after "a bar and air hockey" everything else seems a little academic. It's over by the London Eye, so be prepared to elbow tourists out the way.

Obviously we'll be meeting at the Troc first from 6:30 and then down to the second venue at 7:30. If plans change we'll let everyone know on the mailing list and IRC nearer the time.

Air hockey. Seriously.
