Just a quick post to let you know that the usual second venue for the main meets is undergoing refurbishment, so we're going to have to find a plan B.

Given how the weather in London is uncharacteristically awesome at the moment we're tending towards public drinking. Probably. 2600 London's finest legal 
minds are trying to work out what the hell the [laws even are around drinking in public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Public_Places_Order), 
but I suspect we'll wing it and see if anyone gets arrested. If you're arriving late then keep an eye on the mailing list to find out where to go.

Opinions or alternatives? Let us know on the list or IRC.

See y'all Friday.
