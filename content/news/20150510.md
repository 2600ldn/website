It's taken a while to spool up, but we're making progress on websites and things.

First up: the IRC server. Drop on by! You can get to us on irc.2600.london, the usual ports, and we offer up TLS on 6697 if that's the way you roll. The main idling, gossip, bitching, moaning and taunting channel is #2600, so come socialise.

Next up we're looking for content on the site. If you're interested in writing something, no matter how it's related to hacking, then let someone know at a meet, on the mailing list, or on IRC.

Next meet is June 5th. See you there, nerds.
