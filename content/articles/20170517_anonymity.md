Description: We finally decided to say something about something publicly. Why did we do that? Only time and a psychiatrist will tell.

In the wake of the recent highly publicised WanaDecryptor infections, a number of news outlets have seen fit to reveal the intentionally concealed identity of [@MalwareTechBlog](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog) for his part in halting the spread of the malware.

We believe that this is dangerous, both for MalwareTech himself, who routinely analyses and exposes the malware of organised criminals, and for the chilling effect this irresponsible reporting has on security research in general.

Many of us know each other by only the names we choose for ourselves online. As a group, we've long understood that this anonymity promotes free expression, and the free exchange of information and ideas. We believe that this choice should be available to everyone who needs or wants it, and so we condemn this, as we condemn all unjustifiable deanonymisation.
